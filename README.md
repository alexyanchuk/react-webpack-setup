### ESLint settings

The commands `npm run lint` or `yarn lint` shown all waring and errors

The commands `npm run lint:fix` or `yarn lint:fix` to resolve some errors automatically

**_VS Code configuration_**

-   Press Command + Shift + P then search for Open Settings (JSON) (if you can’t find it, try things mentioned here)
-   Make sure eslint is installed globally using npm install -g eslint or yarn global add eslint

Now we’ll get ESLint and Prettier to perform their magic everytime you save a file. Add the following to your `settings.json`:

```
{
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": { "source.fixAll.eslint": true },
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "eslint.alwaysShowStatus": true,
    "files.autoSave": "onFocusChange"
}
```
